# Instruction

It is necessary that you create a directory in this folder named `uploads`.

Try whichever way you can create the directory in your server, using your servers' OS' UI. 
If you are on a cmd shell then make this directory as root using `cd` command in cmd. Then, type `mkdir uploads`. And you are done.
